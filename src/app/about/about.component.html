  <h2>What do I do?</h2>
  <br> I'm Kwan S. Holloway and I'm a Multimedia Developer.
  <p>
    I design and program things like games websites, and more. I also do a lot of Front-End Development, UI/UX work, as well
    as Digital Art.</p>

  <h2>What interests me?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Games. That's it. Bye.</p>
  <p>Ok no, but I am in love with video games and am constantly playing them. I also love philosphy, digital art, parkour,
    anime, and music.</p>

  <h2>What drives me?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    I'm driven by a yearning to impact other's lives, whether it be by providing a solution to a problem via a web app, or speaking
    on a panel about my expereince.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also motivated by representation. The vast majority of media is portrayed through a certain lens, and it's my goal to
    create more media through new, lesser spoken lenses.
  </p>

  <p>
    And the third thing that drives me is a want to have a fun and interesting life. I want to be creative, design cool sites,
    make fun games, and enjoy life while I'm at it.
  </p>

<div class="bio text-center about-section" id="facts" [@showSection]="navigationSubState.facts" [ngClass]="{'showing': navigationSubState.facts == 'active'}">
  <h2>Fun Facts?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>I've taught myself to be fairly ambidextrous. I love Sherlock Holmes.</p>
  <p>I listen to a lot of music in other languages. I write ciphers in order to decode them later.</p>
