  <h2>What interests me?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Games. That's it. Bye.</p>

  <h2>What drives me?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    I'm driven by a yearning to impact other's lives, whether it be by providing a solution to a problem via a web app, or speaking
    on a panel about my expereince.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also motivated by representation. The vast majority of media is portrayed through a certain lens, and it's my goal to
    create more media through new, lesser spoken lenses.
  </p>

  <p>
    And the third thing that drives me is a want to have a fun and interesting life. I want to be creative, design cool sites,
    make fun games, and enjoy life while I'm at it.
